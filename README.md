# Tinydb

## What

- A currently non-functioning table database.

> [!NOTE]
> Just before writing this README, the whole project was in proof-of-concept
> mode. As a concrete implementation seems possible, the project, including this
> README, is undergoing reorganization.
>
> A dev log and a kind-of todo list is being planned.

## Building

### Building: Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> A container may be provided in the future to help with all these very new
> versions.

- A C++ compiler that supports most of C++23. The newest versions of all major
compilers would suffice.

> [!NOTE]
> Extended testing on which compiler versions are the absolute minimum hasn't
> been done.

- CMake 3.30+.

> [!NOTE]
> `apt` on stable Debian or any of its derivatives (say, Ubuntu or Mint) don't
> supply this version of CMake. Debian sid (the bleeding-edge Debian) seems to
> though.

> [!TODO]
> Continue writing README.
